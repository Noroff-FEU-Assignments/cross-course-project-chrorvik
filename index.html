    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">First of all, great question! Web security is important, and you should have it in mind from the start of any application. Since it’s harder to add later in the process and easier to make mistakes. People and computers will always try to find bugs that are in a web application. To make it simple, we can say that you cannot trust any data that comes from the browser. This means that all data should be sanitized before it is displayed or used in an SQL query or as a call within the application, server-side and client-side. Many of these issues are solved by using different frameworks, but even then, you should be careful and make sure the framework is updated and configurated properly. Only use third party package / applications you trust and keep them updated as well. Always make sure you are not vulnerable to any of the “OWASP Top Ten” categories. Use vulnerability scanning tools like pentest-tools.com to check the status on you site and do it regularly.  Only store data that you need and have the knowledge to handle. For example, if the web application needs authorization and authentication do you know how to store, hash, salt and pepper password? Or should you use well-known third party integration like Okta, auth0 etc. If you follow this advice, the web application will be well on its way to becoming a more secure site. </p>
