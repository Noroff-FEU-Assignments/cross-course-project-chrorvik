This is my repository on GitHub Classroom

### Course Assignment for web and communications technology:construction_worker:
- [x] Create a repository on GitHub Classroom
- [x] Clone the repository to your computer and open in VS Code.
- [x] Create an index.html file in the root folder for your project. It must be called index.html because the server will look for this filename to show as the home page.
- [ ] Add the code under Resources to the index.html file.
- [ ] Answer the web security question in the p element with id web-security-answer
- [ ] Create folders called: ‘css’, ‘js’, and ‘images’. They can be empty folders for now (and if they are empty they won’t show on GitHub). We’ll add to them as we progress in the programme.
- [ ] Commit and push changes to your repository.
- [ ] Deploy the site using Netlify.
