# NOROFF Front End - August part-time

## Christoffer :vulcan_salute:

This is my repository on GitHub Classroom. I use this as a to-do list when planning what to do in each module/course. I use old man :older_man: or woman :older_woman: emojis when finished with the course and the construction worker :construction_worker:  at the task I'm working on.

The git structure I'm using is that I'm working with the branch "dev", and pushing any changes to that. The "main" is the one connected to Netlify and will be the stable branch.

## Course Assignment for HTML & CSS technology :construction_worker:

- [x] Plan the HTML structure and CSS structure

- [x] Follow DRY principle for CSS
- [x] Make sure HTML AND CSS are easy to read
- [x] Make the site reponsive

## Course Assignment for web and communications technology :older_woman:

- [x] Create a repository on GitHub Classroom
- [x] Clone the repository to your computer and open in VS Code.
- [x] Create an index.html file in the root folder for your project. It must be called index.html because the server will look for this filename to show as the home page.
- [x] Add the code under Resources to the index.html file.
- [x] Answer the web security question in the p element with id web-security-answer
- [x] Create folders called: ‘css’, ‘js’, and ‘images’. They can be empty folders for now (and if they are empty they won’t show on GitHub). We’ll add to them as we progress in the programme.
- [x] Commit and push changes to your repository.
- [x] Deploy the site using Netlify
