# NOROFF Front End - August part-time

## Chris :vulcan_salute:

This is my repository on GitHub Classroom. I use this as a to-do list when planning what to do in each module/course. I use old man :older_man: or woman :older_woman: emojis when finished with the course and the construction worker :construction_worker:  at the task I'm working on.

The git structure I'm using is that I'm working with the branch "dev", and pushing any changes to that. The "main" is the one connected to Netlify and will be the stable branch.

## Course Assignment for JavaScript 1 :construction_worker:

- [ ] Ensure there is proper error handling (Unfortunately, I only managed to add some try catch blocks in apiClient and cart.js. Fortunately, I had already put some error handling in storage.js.)
- [x] Looking through the website and assess where API calls need to be made to dynamically add content.
- [x] Remove hardcoded products from the HTML
- [x] Fetch the products from API and dynamically add them to the page with links to the product details page. Here I need to use ID as a query string.
- [x] On the product details page, make a request to the API for the specific data for the product.
- [x] Add loading indicators when making API-calls
- [x] Test site
- [x] Remove console.logs I have been using
- [x] If time - make a working shopping cart
- [x] If time - display correct products on checkout page

Comments: Really don't like the API's. 
* Bad pictures
* Only one gender
* Pictures and colors don't match
* Poor descriptions

## Course Assignment for web and communications technology :older_woman:

- [x] Create a repository on GitHub Classroom
- [x] Clone the repository to your computer and open in VS Code.
- [x] Create an index.html file in the root folder for your project. It must be called index.html because the server will look for this filename to show as the home page.
- [x] Add the code under Resources to the index.html file.
- [x] Answer the web security question in the p element with id web-security-answer
- [x] Create folders called: ‘css’, ‘js’, and ‘images’. They can be empty folders for now (and if they are empty they won’t show on GitHub). We’ll add to them as we progress in the programme.
